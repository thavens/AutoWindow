# AutoWindow
Automatic window for my window!
use to your liking

# How It Works
This window opener gets and parses weather data from Openweather API using an ESP8266 (ESP-01) which is then serially transmits the data to the Arduino UNO. The arduino UNO is programmed to control the window with stepper motors interfaced to the window with a rack and pinion. The window has a limit switch for the closed state to guarantee accurate closing ever time.
